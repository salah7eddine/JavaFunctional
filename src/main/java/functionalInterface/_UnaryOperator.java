/*
The Java UnaryOperator interface is a functional interface that represents an operation which takes a single parameter and returns a parameter of the same type.
Here is an example of a Java UnaryOperator implementation:

    UnaryOperator<Person> unaryOperator =
            (person) -> { person.name = "New Name"; return person; };

The UnaryOperator interface can be used to represent an operation that takes a specific object as parameter, modifies that object,
and returns it again - possibly as part of a functional stream processing chain.
